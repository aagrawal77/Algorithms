# Binary Search

To run on Mac: $ python3 binarysearch.py

To run on Windows: $ python binarysearch.py

This program will create a list of cities from cities.csv, sort the list (using bubble sort), and then ask the user to input the name of a city (via the command prompt). It then uses binary search to find the city in the list (and prints out the indexes where the list is split each time), and prints to the console whether or not it found the city in the list.
